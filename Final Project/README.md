# Workspace Organizer

Many workspaces are out there using hand-written based solutions for organization. We need to create a website for them because it's much better, easier, faster and less error-prone.

Here you can find :
- [Entities and their relations](#entities)
- [Users and their privilages](#users)
- [Screens and functionality needed](#screens)
- [Technology usage requirements](#technology)
- [Deployment requirements](#deployment)
- [Schedule for Phases and support](#schedule)
- [BONUS WORK ! ðŸŽ‰](#bonus-work-!-ðŸŽ‰)

1. Guest

## Technology

- CSR using Axios to connect FE with BE
- GitHub for project management (Both FE and BE should be on the same repo having BE in a folder called `api`)
- React for Frontend (use create-react-app to create it)
- NodeJS for backend
- MongoDB
- ESLint for linting (Airbnb style guide)

## Deployment

- Database on Atlas
- BE and FE on the same Dino on Heroku

## Schedule

1. Phase 1 (First 7 pages (50%))
2. Final phase (The rest pages (50%) + BONUS)
> Timing to be determined

## BONUS WORK ! ðŸŽ‰

- Add Courses and Instructors to the websites. A course is a special type of an Event (multiple reservation) and Instructor is a special type of Guests. You should add the entities and the screens for _viewers_ (like show all courses - show single course) also _admin_ pages (add course, add instructor, manage Courses)

- Dockerize db, BE and FE and run them locally !
