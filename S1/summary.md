# Session 1 Summary

### In the previous session, we covered :-

1- Where are we physically - in this point I mean by "We" the HTML page we gonna write - ? We're the information that's send between the __Server__ - a masive robust computer running 24/7 somewhere in the world containing all the files of the file -  and the computer, the __Client__, requisting us - represented in the __Browser__, like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, ...

2- Where are we in the development process of a full website ? Well, we're the second step :smile:. The first step is the __Web Design__, which is just a branch of __Graphic Design__. It has 2 concerns, __UI__ or user interface and __UX__ or user experience. UI and UX Designers use tools like Photoshop & Illustrator, then deliver us a `.psd` file containing the __GUI__ - How our site gonna look at the end - then we start to code it in the languages we gonna use, __HTML__, __CSS__, __Javascript__

3- The Tools we gonna use during the course
