# Session 1 Tools - Building the envirnoment
## Here are the offline tools we gonna use throughout the course time

1- Visual Studio Code (VSC): 
 - This is our code editor and IDE
 - You can download the latest stable version via [this link](https://aka.ms/win32-x64-user-stable)
 - When you install it, 
 - Any Extensions can be downloaded from inside the editor
 - Ask me if you find any problems installing it

2- Git - not Github - :
 - These are the tools of Git, the version control system that we'll use and the heart of GitHub
 - It enables us to run the `git` command in the terminal window of VSC, and gives us a "Bash" - a terminal window - to run the Git commands
 - You can download that from here [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
 - Setup it easily with the default settings "next .. next .. next .. finish"

3- Some useful VSC Extensions :
 - I'll provide you links but you can download it from the Extension tab in VSC
 - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) : An easy way to run the front-end web code and see the changes dynamically on save
 - [HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css)
 - [Auto close tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag): Auto update closing tag when you change the opening tag

## Good Luck :fire:
