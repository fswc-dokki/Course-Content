# Session 2 Task - Due data is left to you to determine in Trello
## First of all, let me thank [SalmaBaik](https://www.github.com/SalmaBaik) for being the first to solve the previous task :fire:. This encourages her to keep up beat and you to catch up with her.

### You're required to finish as much as you can from these points

- In the curriculum section of [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org), Study and solve up to the lesson ["Basic CSS: Specify How Fonts Should Degrade"](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/specify-how-fonts-should-degrade/). Show your solution to the instructor next session. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJza83nWFSA&t=43s) for how to use freeCodeCamp

- Search [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) for CSS Selectors, and solve as much as you can of [this excersies](https://codepen.io/hmana6399/pen/XWrpVRv). Follow these steps before you start:-
  - Make sure you're signed-in in Codepen before you start.
  - Click on the "Fork" Button in the top bar of this excersise
  - Start solving it.
  - When you're done, post the link in a comment on Trello as before.
  - Remember, this is an Exercise on __CSS Selectors__, so if the CSS styling in the exercise is new to you, just use something you know, or even better, Search MDN for it and give it a shot :wink:  

- Play with the website "Khiiar" we created the last time and try to style it as you can. Show this to the instructor next time isA. I'll include this project here in S2 folder.
  
### Good Luck :heart:
