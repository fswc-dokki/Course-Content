Again, solve as much as you can of :-

1- In freeCodeCamp.org curriculum, there's a main section called __Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours)__ , Solve as much as you can of the first 2 Subsections of it : _Basic JavaScript_ and _ES6_ . Finishing these boosts your JS knowledge forward 💪

2- Solve [this problem](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher) in freeCodeCamp.org. Post the code in a new pen in Codepen and place the link in the comments section in Trello.
